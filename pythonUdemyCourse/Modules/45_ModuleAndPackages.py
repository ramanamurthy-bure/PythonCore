# PyPi is a repository for open-source third-party python packages
# It's similar to RubyGems in Ruby world, PHP's packagist, CPAN for Perl, and NPM for Node.js
# So far we've really only used libraries that come internally with Python
# There are many other libraries available that people have open-sourced and shared on PyPi.
# We can use pip install at the command line to install these pakages
# pip is a simple way to download packages at your command line directly from the PyPi repository
# There are packages already created for almost any use case you can think of!
# A quick google search will usually help you discover a link to the PyPi page for the package,
# or for the package documentation

# import openpyxl -> TO work with the excel in python

# Modules are just .py scripts that you call in another .py script
# Packages are a collection of modules
# Let's create some examples
